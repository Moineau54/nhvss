## What is nhvss ?

Nhvss (**N**map **H**ost **V**ulnerability **S**canner **S**cript) is a python tool that allows you to scan a network for vulnerabilities. It uses [Nmap](https://nmap.org/book/man.html#man-description) to scan the network and uses the **vulners** script to scan the discovered hosts for vulnerabilities.

## How it works ?

The script uses Nmap to index any host on the network and then uses the **vulners** script to scan the hosts for vulnerabilities. The hosts Networkadresses are stored in a file that goes by a similar name as **YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MinMin-SS_hosts.txt**. The script will then scan the hosts in the file for vulnerabilities and stores the results of each host in seperate files in the [scan_history](scan_history) folder.

## Pre-requisites

Currently the script only works on Linux systems. The script requires the following packages to be installed:

- Nmap
- Python3

## How to install ?

To install the script you need to have Nmap and Python installed on your system. You can install Nmap by running the following command:

### on Debian based systems

```bash
sudo apt-get install nmap
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```

### on RedHat based systems

```bash
sudo yum install nmap
```

```bash
sudo yum install python3
```

### on Arch based systems

I currently don't know the command to install Nmap on Arch based systems. If you know the command please let me know.

### on fedora based systems

```bash
sudo dnf install nmap
```

```bash
sudo dnf install python3
```

After you have installed Nmap and Python3 you can install the script by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moineau54/nhvss_python.git
cd Path/to/nhvss_python
```

### Setup the script

Now, if you're on linux or Mac, first make the script executable by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install_linux_mac.sh
```

Then run the script by running the following command:

```bash
./install_linux_mac.sh
```

If you're on Windows, run the **install_win.bat** file.

### How to use it ?

Run the script by running the following command:

```bash
# You have to launch the script from the git repository
python /path/to/nmapy.py
```

The script will then ask you if you want to additionally scan the hosts for vulnerabilities. If you want to scan the hosts for vulnerabilities type **y** and press enter. If you don't want to scan the hosts for vulnerabilities type **n** and press enter.

## Warning

The script is still in development and may not work as intended. If you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions please let me know.
